        It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples 
        that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, 
        England. Both names derive from Anglia, 
        a peninsula on the Baltic Sea. English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Old Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as Latin and French.
